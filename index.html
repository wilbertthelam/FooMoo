<p>Imagine Linsen is sitting at his desk in a cabin in the mountains of Colorado enjoying a ranked game of League of Legends, when suddenly an urge of hunger appears. Linsen goes "I'm hungry! I want food!" So he hits up his best friend Jane, who's busy climbing mountains 2.76 miles away. He whips out his Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge and fires a text to Jane.  "I'm hungry Jane! Let's get some falafel." Jane gags and nearly falls off a steep incline.  "Nasty. I want fettuccine alfredo." Linsen lets out an exasperated fart.  He's glucose and lactose intolerant. They continue to bicker for the next 15 minutes while Linsen's League of Legends team sends expletives at his lack of response and Jane's brother Andrew continues to ascend without her at an alarming pace.<img src="story_pic.jpg"></p>

<a id="its-a-solution" href="#its-a-solution"></a>It's a Solution!</h3>

<p><em>Ding ding</em>. Linsen's and Jane's phones pop up with a message from their accomplice-in-crime Wilbert. "Hey stop bickering and download FooMoo."  Neither blinks twice at the fact that Wilbert is aware that they are arguing over food. "Wow! This really works!" says Linsen. "I can set my craving and I'll see who else wants the same thing!" exclaims Jane.  "Hey! It look's like Wilbert also wants pasta.  I'll invite him to lunch at Linguini Grill! I guess I'll invite Linsen too and we'll see if he shows up."  Seconds later, Wilbert RSVP's to the event and Linsen follows shortly.  "I guess I can get a salad" mutters Linsen. "It's better than eating alone again."</p>
